Recently, I have been exploring **multimodal learning (text + image)** for misinformation detection, and I am interested in developing robust and trustworthy ML pipelines that work well in low-resource settings.

My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful research in academia or leading AI research labs.

## Primary Research Interests

- Large Language Models (LLMs), instruction tuning, and lightweight fine-tuning (LoRA/PEFT)
- Multimodal AI (text + image), vision-language models
- NLP for low-resource languages (Bangla-focused evaluation & dataset work)
- Trustworthy AI: robustness, calibration, and reliable ML evaluation
- Generative AI workflows and deployment-ready pipelines

## Software & Systems Background

- Backend development with SQL-backed systems
- Building APIs for model inference
- ML deployment pipelines and reproducible workflows
- Dashboard systems and CRUD-based web applications
