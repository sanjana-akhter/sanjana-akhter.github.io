# 👋 Hello, I'm Sanjana Akhter

I am a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from **Ahsanullah University of Science & Technology (AUST)**, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

My research interests lie in:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Bengali NLP and low-resource language modeling
- Multimodal misinformation detection (text + image)
- Sentiment analysis and fake news detection

I am passionate about building reliable and socially impactful AI systems, particularly for underrepresented and low-resource languages.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My work focuses on applied machine learning and modern NLP techniques, including:

- Transformer-based architectures (BERT and variants)
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained models
- Class imbalance handling techniques
- Feature selection and model optimization
- Model evaluation and error analysis
- Robustness in real-world datasets

I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between theoretical ML research and practical deployment in real-world settings.
